There are a few Python files in this folder. 

The functions.py file should not be touched and contains the neccessary functions that other python files require. 

The Scenarios (understanding).py file is the Python file used to understand create the baseline parameters of the dataset. As well as comparing the labelled clusters paramaters with the baseline parameters. 

The Scenarios (visualization).py file is used to visualize the clusters after clustering. The graphs shown are a response against scenario graph, based on the centroid of each cluster. 

The Speed Class (understanding).py file is used to understand the data distribution and mean values of the self-report speed class for fast, moderate and slow speed. 

The Speed Points (understanding).py file is used to acheive the same the objective as the speed class Python file, except that this deals with each speed points instead of the class.
